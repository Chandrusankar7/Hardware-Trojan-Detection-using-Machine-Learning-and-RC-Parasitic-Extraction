The Trojan circuit has three inputs and one output net. Two inputs are provided to the AND gate which produces a high signal when both the inputs are high, the output of AND gate is provided to the sequential logicâ€™s clock ports, so the output of the AND gate acts as the positive-edge clock signal for the sequential logic. Th Hardware Trojan is designed in gate level model
The sequential logic consists of for D flip flop, when the first active clock edge is received, the LSB DFF will be instantiated with a high signal and for the net active clock edge, next LSB DFF will produce high signal, this process continues until the MSB DFF becomes high. They functionality is similar that of representation of time-bomb circuits. The sequence of signals obtained for each active clock edge from MSB to LSB DFF will be 0000 -> 0001 -> 0011 -> 0111 -> 1111. 
The fourth DFF i.e. the MSB DFF output will be provided as one of the input to the XOR gate, so until the high signal obtained from the sequential logic, the XOR gate will be acting as follower circuit and once high signal is required, then it will be acting as an inverter. Another input to the XOR gate is obtained from the output of the circuit, so output value inversion is performed using this Sequential Hardware Trojan circuit.
