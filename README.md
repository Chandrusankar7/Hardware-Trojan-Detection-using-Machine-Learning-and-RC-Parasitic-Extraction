# Hardware-Trojan-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-RC-Parasitic-Extraction
In this project, we try to detetc an Hardware Trojan withput providing excessive inputs or activiting the Hardware Trojan using RC parasitic extraction and Machine learning based clustering algorithm. Whenever any excessive elements are addes into any circuit, the number of nets will be increased and the net in which the elements are connected will have a change in RC value, using these parameters, Hardware Trojan's presence, nets and power, RC properties are detected.
