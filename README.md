# Hardware-Trojan-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-RC-Parasitic-Extraction
In this project, we try to detect an Hardware Trojan without providing excessive inputs to the DUT or activating the Hardware Trojan, which is done using RC parasitic extraction and Machine learning based clustering algorithm. Whenever any excessive elements are added into any circuit, the number of nets will be increased and the net in which the elements are connected will have a change in RC value, using these parameters, Hardware Trojan's presence, nets and power, RC properties are detected.
